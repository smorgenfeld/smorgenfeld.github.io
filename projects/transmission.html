					The transmission contest was the first of two group projects for Design and Fabrication (ME14).  The ultimate goal of the contest
					was to design and manufacture a gearbox to mate a motor to a free-spinning bicycle wheel.  Gearboxes were scored based on how quickly
					they accelerated the wheel and the wheel's final RPM.  To that end, we built a planetary gearbox, both because a planetary gear
					arrangement is on paper more efficient than a two-stage spur gear arrangement, and because the design would be an interesting challenge.
					There were plenty of examples of other gearbox types from previous competitions; none were planetary gearboxes.
					<p/>
					One early challenge we encountered was the ring gear limiting both our choices of gearbox ratio and our budget.  We were forced to
					 select a less-than-optimal 6.5:1 ratio, and drop the number of planet gears from 3 to 2.  The best solution to this (waterjet our
					 own gears) wasn't allowed under competition rules.
					<p/>
					The major issue we encountered was a misalignment between the ring gear and the planetary gears, probably due to errors during machining.
					The gearbox ran best when the ring gear was allowed to wobble slightly; if it was fully constrained, the gears started to wear against each
					 other, to the point that aluminum dust was visible beneath the gears after only a short amount of run time.
					<p/>
					While the end product wasn't perfect, this project left me with a newfound appreciation for planetary gearbox design, valuable machining experience,
					and a reminder to account for manufacturing error during the design process.
